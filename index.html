To fight the Kaiju, mankind developed giant robots called Jaegers, designed to be piloted by two humans locked together in a neural bridge. However, even the Jaegers are not enough to defeat the Kaiju, and humanity is on the verge of defeat. Mankind's last hope now lies with a washed-up ex-pilot (Charlie Hunnam), an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) and an old, obsolete Jaeger.</td>

						<td class="bg-dark text-warning col-lg-4"><br>"Five out of Five - 5/5, What I love about "Pacific Rim" is that it pays attention to both style and substance, and it gets seriously involved in having a ton of fun as well. Highly recommended (suitable for teens thirteen and up)," -Kyle Vansteelandt<br><span1><br>"Awesome movie, amazing plot, out of this world designs. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in theaters and thinking how amazing it was, I just saw it again today and I still feel the exact same way. The plot is complex but not inherently difficult to understand, the CGI has held up amazingly, and I enjoy the fact that focus a lot on the plot and tend to leave the romance aspect on the back burner. You can still tell there's romantic tension between the two main characters but I like the fact that it's not in your face and taking up the entirety of the plot like a lot of other action movies. 10/10 definitely recommend to watch!" -Iris Ianovale<br></span1></td>

						<td class="bg-dark text-warning col-lg-4"><br>"I absolutely loved this movie from start to finish. Sci-fi RPG style storytelling with just the right level of warhammer 40k grimdark.Without even giving much screentime to give backround to many of the characters I liked all of them, and you can try work out their character motivions.There's this scary nazi coded villian which gives such a well acted and suspenseful performance. Main character is like a space marine or spartan from halo, any sort of super enhanced elite soldier deal.I was hesitant at the strong female lead after a couple corporate soulless attempts at girlbossing in movies, but the movie doesn't do that at all & people just whining and nitpicking at that point." -anonymous<br><span1><br>" I‚Äôm all for inclusion and gender equality, I think the gender role reversal in Rebel Moon was too extreme and a bit too blatant, portraying men as weak, incompetent and clueless under stress. I like the strong portrayal of Sofia (Kora) but I was offended by the disparity in how men vs women was depicted. I realize it‚Äôs a movie, but if we are expected to believe Kora can rise to the level heroin that she does, there should be some expectation that there is at least one male hero in the room. Just one man‚Äôs point of view‚Ä¶" -Harmon Moats<br></span1></td>

Be open minded, and give this movie a shot - ‚Äúthe movie feels rush, 1 dimensional, no character development‚Äù really? Have the critics seen the movies produced lately? All remakes, no originality (majority of the Disney movie remakes, Willy Wonka, etc). I give this at least 7/10." -Felix Liu</span2></td>
